# FWYshop-On-Line-Store
FWYshop is an on-line-store which contains 90 products in 6 categories. The project has 3 levels of pages: the main page (index.html), the search result page and the product's detail page.
It includes the following functions:
1, Search the products by keyword;
2, Sort the products by price, name and rating;
3, Filter the products by price range;
4, Add new products through a formatted web page;
5, Shopping Carts functions, ie. put all products the client picks from different pages, compute purchase amount, and output the formal invoice;

However, there's still one error which is being fixed:
In GitHub, the project can not access the database I created. That's why all the products information is missing (ig. pictures, detailed introduction). Before I figure it out, if anyone
wants to see how the functions are played in this project, please leave me a message, I will show you on my own server.

Sorry for the error again!
